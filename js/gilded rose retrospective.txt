Good
====
Lots of perspectives
Lots of discussion about details
If we had done this all the way, we would have come out with shared understanding



Bad
====
Want a linter
Seemed slower than one person
Used lots of people's time
Lots of discussion about minute details
It would be frustrating to do this a lot



Comments
========
Started from a test-heavy perspective
We didn't read the code
Code looked fragile
"use strict"
Want tests to continually refresh
Setting the standards early seems good
Hard for everybody to participate in navigating
Hard to pick a level of abstraction
Very prescriptive ("type this")
Might have changed as we got familiar with the process
Whoever talks the loudest gets control
It would help for the driver to be able to give ideas
